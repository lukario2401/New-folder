        <h1>asthma sympthoms and how to cure it</h1>
        <p>
            Bronchial asthma is a long-lasting inflammation of the respiratory system. It leads to recurring episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, coughing, and trouble breathing. These symptoms often happen at night or in the early morning. The inflammation and narrowing of the airways cause these symptoms.
            Genetics and environmental factors are the main causes of asthma development and worsening.
            People with bronchial asthma may have the following signs and symptoms:
            
            Difficulty breathing
            Feeling of tightness in the chest
            Wheezing
            Continuous coughing that disturbs sleep
            For patients over 5-6 years old, lung function is evaluated with tests like spirometry or Peak Expiratory Flow to assess how air moves in and out of the lungs and identify any airflow changes.After diagnosis, a healthcare provider will prescribe asthma medication, such as inhalers and pills. They may also recommend lifestyle changes to manage and prevent future asthma attacks. Although asthma cannot be cured, there are effective medications available to prevent symptoms.

        <p>Your lungs are a big part of your breathing system, which includes different body parts that help you breathe. They are used to make oxygen travel through our body. It gives oxygen to blood. While heart is pumping it, it supplies it with oxygen.
            It it also prevalent in the process of gas exchange. Gas exchange is the process of taking in oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide in our bodies. It occurs in the lungs through the diffusion of gases in the tiny air sacs called alveoli.</p>

    <h1>Nose</h1>
    <p>When you breathe in, air flows through your nostrils and enters the nasal cavity. 
        Cells in the nasal cavity release mucus. This mucus contains enzymes called lysozymes. They kill bacteria for us.
        The outside of the nasal cavity has nose hairs that get coated with the mucus. This helps them trap a lot of different slightly harmful particles, etc.</p>

        Food and air actually take the same road into the body until they reach the top part of 
        In that part, there is a little flap- the epiglottis.
        Its kind of like a lid. It closes off the lid when you are eating so that food can only go in one direction, the esophagus, and for you to not chokeâ€¦
        If anything other than air accidentally enters the larynx, the body triggers a cough reflex to get it out as quick as possible!

    <h1>Larynx</h1>

        The larynx is a tube that allows air to travel from your throat to your lungs. It contains your vocal cords as well! Some people call it the voice box.

    <h1>Trachea</h1>
    <p>
        The trachea is a tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi! It's main function is to transport air. When we inhale, the air goes through a long(or not very) journey that includes going through the trachea to get to the lungs.

        Normal lungs and asthma lungs have several key differences. Asthma lungs are characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways, resulting in swollen and narrow passages. In asthma lungs, inflammation leads to hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity of the airway smooth muscles, resulting in stronger constriction and difficulty in breathing.Asthma lungs also produce excessive mucus, which can form plugs and further obstruct the airways. In terms of alveolar function, asthma can impair gas exchange, reducing oxygen intake and increasing carbon dioxide retention.

        Asthmatic lungs display chronic inflammation, excessive mucus, thickened bronchial walls, enlarged smooth muscles, and mucus plug formation.
