    <h1>Nose</h1>
    <p>When you breathe in, air flows through your nostrils and enters the nasal cavity. 
        Cells in the nasal cavity release mucus. This mucus contains enzymes called lysozymes. They kill bacteria for us.
        The outside of the nasal cavity has nose hairs that get coated with the mucus. This helps them trap a lot of different slightly harmful particles, etc.</p>
