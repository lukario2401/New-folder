        <p>Your lungs are a big part of your breathing system, which includes different body parts that help you breathe. They are used to make oxygen travel through our body. It gives oxygen to blood. While heart is pumping it, it supplies it with oxygen.
            It it also prevalent in the process of gas exchange. Gas exchange is the process of taking in oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide in our bodies. It occurs in the lungs through the diffusion of gases in the tiny air sacs called alveoli.</p>

    <h1>Nose</h1>
    <p>When you breathe in, air flows through your nostrils and enters the nasal cavity. 
        Cells in the nasal cavity release mucus. This mucus contains enzymes called lysozymes. They kill bacteria for us.
        The outside of the nasal cavity has nose hairs that get coated with the mucus. This helps them trap a lot of different slightly harmful particles, etc.</p>

    <h1>Epiglottis</h1>
    <p>
        Food and air actually take the same road into the body until they reach the top part of 
        In that part, there is a little flap- the epiglottis.
        Its kind of like a lid. It closes off the lid when you are eating so that food can only go in one direction, the esophagus, and for you to not chokeâ€¦
        If anything other than air accidentally enters the larynx, the body triggers a cough reflex to get it out as quick as possible!

    <h1>Trachea</h1>
    <p>
        The trachea is a tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi! It's main function is to transport air. When we inhale, the air goes through a long(or not very) journey that includes going through the trachea to get to the lungs.
