            It it also prevalent in the process of gas exchange. Gas exchange is the process of taking in oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide in our bodies. It occurs in the lungs through the diffusion of gases in the tiny air sacs called alveoli.</p>

    <h1>Nose</h1>
    <p>When you breathe in, air flows through your nostrils and enters the nasal cavity. 
        Cells in the nasal cavity release mucus. This mucus contains enzymes called lysozymes. They kill bacteria for us.
        The outside of the nasal cavity has nose hairs that get coated with the mucus. This helps them trap a lot of different slightly harmful particles, etc.</p>

    <h1>Epiglottis</h1>
    <p>
        Food and air actually take the same road into the body until they reach the top part of 
        In that part, there is a little flap- the epiglottis.
        Its kind of like a lid. It closes off the lid when you are eating so that food can only go in one direction, the esophagus, and for you to not choke…
        If anything other than air accidentally enters the larynx, the body triggers a cough reflex to get it out as quick as possible!

    <h1>Larynx</h1>
    <p>
        The larynx is a tube that allows air to travel from your throat to your lungs. It contains your vocal cords as well! Some people call it the voice box.
